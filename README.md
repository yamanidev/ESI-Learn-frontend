# About

A school management web application for staff, teachers and students as well as an e-learn platform.

## What I learned from the experience

- Firsthand experience with a JavaScript framework/library, React and developing SPAs
- Dividing an application into modular components/sub-components
- First time working with a back end developer and communicating in terms of API endpoints
- Routing and navigation with React Router v6
- JWT authentication, although it was done poorly

## Project requirements

- Node version >= 14.0.0
- npm version >= 5.6

## Running the project locally

1. `npm install` to install the project's dependencies

2. `npm start` to run the app in development mode on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

3. Run the [backend](https://github.com/errros/ESI-E-Learning)

## Production and deployment

`npm run build` to build and optimize the project for production in the `build` folder. It applies minification and filename hashing.
